# HCV_Game_Theory
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major causes of liver disease, causing massive health and economic burden worldwide. In its early stages, the disease is asymptomatic but it can progress over time to fatal end-stage liver disease. The majority of those infected with HCV are unaware of their chronical condition. Recent treatment options for HCV can completely cure the infection but are costly. We developed a game model between a pharmaceutical company (PC) and a country striving to maximize the utility of its citizens. First, the PC determines the price of HCV treatment. Then, the country responds with corresponding screening and treatment strategies. We employed an analytical framework to calculate the utility of the players for each strategy chosen, considering an infinite time horizon. Calibrated to detailed HCV data, we found that the PC will gain higher revenue offering a quantity discount rather than standard linear pricing, by indirectly forcing the country to conduct more screening than it desires. We also present several strategies to substantially mitigate this suboptimal outcome for the country. Thus, policy makers worldwide should prudently consider recent offers by PCs to increase screening either directly â€“ via covering of HCV screening or indirectly by providing discounts following a predetermined volume of sales. Our approach provides a rational explanation for the current agreements between countries and PCs. It is also applicable in other healthcare settings where screening is essential to determine treatment strategies.
